# Fire Emblem Tool
Very much WIP, let's see where we'll get to.

## Running
``` bash
npm run watch
```
``` bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage
### Main app
Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser
Click on 'Chrom'
### Scraper
Go to `localhost:8081` in your browser
You can use characterName as a query parameter (e.g. `http://localhost:8081/?characterName=Chrom`) to search for different characters.
